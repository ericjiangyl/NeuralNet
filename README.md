# NeuralNet
School AI classwork

All files were written in C++ and tested in cygwin on a Windows 10 system. There are total of three source files. The training_neural.cpp is used to train the neural network,  test_neural.cpp is used to test how well the neural network performs and generate_weight.cpp is used to generate pseudo random initial weights for the network working on the self-picked data set.
